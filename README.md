## Description

This project is a simple weather app that displays both current and forecasted weather.
I created this project for the purpose of improving my React and custom styling skills.

## Built With

- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)

## Installation

#### WeatherAPI

This project uses WeatherAPI to fetch data. You will need to sign up on their website for a free API key.

1. Create your account [here](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx) and subscribe to the free plan to obtain your API key.
2. Open the project and go to the Weather.js file.
3. Replace the "x-rapidapi-key" with your key.

## Issues

Currently this app works best on desktop screens only.
I plan to add responsive design so the app will function properly on all screen types.
